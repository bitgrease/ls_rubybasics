a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |a|
  a += 1
end

puts a

So, I'm kind of afraid to answer this since I've not done so well on the previous two but... here goes.

In this scenario, I believe that, since the parameter is named the same as the outerscoped variable that a local 'a' will be created. Since it's being used with an assignment operator (which doesn't mutate the caller), the local 'a' will get a reference to a new location with the result and, after the method completes, the externally scoped 'a' will remain 7. 

Fingers crossed...
