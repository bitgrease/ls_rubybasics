array = [1, 2, 3]

Pre-run answer:

Since the block is inside a method, the block shouldn't have access to the local variable 'a'. I believe this will throw a NameError: undefined local variable 'a' exception.

a will remain 7 after the method fails.

Post-run answer:

Close, error but got an undefined method error for '+' on NilClass (since a is undefined).

a outputs 7.
