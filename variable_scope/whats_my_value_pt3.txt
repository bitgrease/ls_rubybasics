a = 7

def my_value(b)
  a = b
end

my_value(a + 5)
puts a

Pre-run answer:

In this scenario, since we're passing the reference to the value 12 in as variable b and then assigning that <em>reference</em> to a (which is using the a from the outside scope). The puts a after the method will output 12.

Post-run answer:

a outputs 7

I was completely wrong :/

Inside a method, the outer scoped variables are not accessible, I was getting confused with procs/lambdas. Learning achieved :)
