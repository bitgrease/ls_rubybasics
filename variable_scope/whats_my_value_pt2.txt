a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a


Pre-run answer:

This is the same as the previous exercise. Just because the method variable and the outside scope variable have the same id doesn't change how Ruby behaves in this scenario.

puts a will be 7 after the method runs.

Post-run answer

puts a outputs '7'
