a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |element|
  a = element
end

puts a

Pre-run answer:

Because .each is a method, I believe the same behavior will result as in any other method seen previously, meaning, the outside scope a will remain 7 after the method completes.

a outputs 7

Post-run answer:

And I am wrong again :(

The output was 3. My mistake was that, although each is a method, the do/end portion is a block (separate from the each method) and, blocks have access to the outer scope variables. So, each time a = happens, it's actually assigning the reference for each element to the outer (actually same level of scope) variable a.

Again, learning achieved :)
