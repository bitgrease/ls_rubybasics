a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b[2] = '-'
end

my_value(a)
puts a

Pre-run answer:

Since, we're using the [] method on String b (which will act just like an Array), the method will mutate the caller. That means, the value referenced by the location stored in b (which is the same as 'a' in the outer scope) will be modified.

After the method, a will contain the value "Xy-zy"

Post-run answer:

"Xy-zy"
